Set Interface
==============

- Defines an unordered collection.
- Cannot store duplicate values in this.
- Impelmentation is done using  HashedSet, LinkedHashSet and TreeSet.
- All the classes of Set interface are internally backed up by Map
 Syntax
 ======
  Set<Data-Type> hs = new HashSet<Data-Type>();
  Set<Data-Type> lhs = new LinkedHashSet<Data-Type>();
  Set<Data-Type> ts = new TreeSet<Data-Type>();
  
  
Like every other descendant of the Collection library, we can iterate through a LinkedHashSet. Two types of iterators are available in a LinkedHashSet: Iterator and Spliterator.

While the former is only able to traverse and perform any basic operation on a Collection, the latter splits the Collection into subsets and performs different operations on each subset in parallel, thereby making it thread-safe.
